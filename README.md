# sftp-browser

## Changes

-   Instead of storing connections in the client browser, these are now stored in the server
    -   On window load (`index.js`, `window.addEventListener('load', ...)`) get the stored connections

```js
if (Object.keys(connections).length === 0) {
	console.log("Connections not loaded yet, waiting...");
	await initializeConnections();
}
```

# Original README

A web-based SFTP file browser that makes managing your server files easy!

![Screenshot](./screenshot.png)

SFTP Browser is still in development, but you can play with it at [sftpbrowser.cybah.me](https://sftpbrowser.cybah.me). In addition to the web interface, there's a fully-built SFTP HTTP API that's used for interfacing with the origin server.

This line was written using the text file editor built into SFTP Browser!!

## Features

-   Connect to SFTP servers hosted on any platform
-   Import and export server connections
-   Navigate directories with ease
-   Sort files by different attributes
-   Show or hide hidden (dot) files
-   Switch between list and tile views
-   Download multiple files/directories as a single zip file
-   Upload files by dragging and dropping or using the button
-   Create new files and directories
-   Rename and delete files
-   Cut/copy/paste files between directories

-   Full mobile support with a responsive UI

## API Basics

### Authentication

All API endpoints require a set of request headers for connecting to the target server:

-   `sftp-host`: The hostname of the server
-   `sftp-port`: The port of the server
-   `sftp-username`: The username to log into
-   `sftp-password`: The password, if using password authentication
-   `sftp-key`: The **private** key, if using public key authentication

### Response format

All API responses are in JSON format and include a boolean `success` property. This is `true` if no errors were encountered, or `false` otherwise. If an error was encountered, a string `error` property is included, which contains an error description.

Successful response example:

```json
{
	"success": true,
	"...": "..."
}
```

Failed response example:

```json
{
	"success": false,
	"error": "[error description]",
	"...": "..."
}
```

Failed responses will always use a 400 or 500 level HTTP status code.
